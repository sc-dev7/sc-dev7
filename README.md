## Nice to meet you I'm an enthusiastic developer ðŸ‘‹

Currently a third-year Bachelorâ€™s student at Aix Ynov Campus, I'm actively seeking an IT apprenticeship. During my time at Epitech, I developed strong skills in C and C++ programming. Additionally, I'm currently self-teaching Full Stack development, expanding my expertise in building dynamic and secure web applications.

Iâ€™m always open to learning and growth, which is why I welcome constructive feedback from fellow developers. I believe in continuous improvement and collaboration to build robust, innovative solutions. Iâ€™m eager to contribute to exciting projects and exchange knowledge within the developer community.
