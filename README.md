## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Currently a third-year Bachelorâ€™s student at Aix Ynov Campus, I am actively seeking an IT apprenticeship. During my time at Epitech, I developed strong skills in C and C++ programming. Additionally, I am currently teaching myself Full Stack development, expanding my expertise to build dynamic and secure web applications.

I'm always open to learning and growing, which is why I welcome constructive feedback from fellow developers. I believe in continuous improvement and collaboration to build robust, innovative solutions. I'm eager to contribute to exciting projects and exchange knowledge within
the developer community.
